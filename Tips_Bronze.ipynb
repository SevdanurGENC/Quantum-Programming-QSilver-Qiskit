    "\n",
    "#### First Quantum Programs with Qiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first notebook qiskit is introduced. Although we have not covered the properties of qubits yet, in principal, all reversible classical circuits can be implmeneted as a quantum circuit. This is what we do here. We implement a NOT operation in a quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main things to emphasize in this notebook are the following:\n",
    "- Syntax of forming circuits: (what quantum and classical registers are needed for) A common question asked by the participants is \"why we need classical register?\" The resason is to save the outcome of the measurement which is classical. (Note that after measurement what you get is a classical output) In general, it is also possible to construct circuits without creating registers first i.e. QuantumCircuit(3,3), or it is possible to create a circuit with multiple quantum registers. This is not what we usually do in Bronze, but in case someone asks, you can say that it is also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Components when you print the circuit: Such as X gate and measurement symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurement: You need to measure a qubit to read the result. Otherwise. all qubits will result in 0, as they are initially all 0. (This is important! All qubits are initially in 0 state) You can try removing the measure command and see what happens. If you will measure 5 qubits, then you need at least 5 classical bits. It is possible that there are 10 qubtis in a circuit but you only measure 5 of them, so you need a classical register of only 5 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shots: Since quantum circuits are probabilistic in general, we run the same circuit more than once. This is the number of shots. Same circuit is constructed and executed independently multiple times. Default is 1024 if you do not specify anything. There are multiple simulators in Qiskit. The one we use here where we specify shots and colect statistics is the qasm_simulator. In this notebook, this is hard to see as NOT gate acts deterministic and it always gives the same output. This will become clear in the next notebook. (It is important to note that we are just \"simulating\" a quantum circuit, not running somehing on real quantum computer. If we did it, it is very likely that we see ten 0s and 990 1s when we are expecting 1000 1s, because of the noise.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple qubits: This is really important. The qubit order in qiskit is reversed. You read the state from right to left. When you print a circuit, qubits are again in reverse order. This is somehting that is confused at the beginning."

Now we also learn about Hadamard matrix, and how it affects on the qubit's state. Now it is clear why we observe 0 and 1 with equal probability. Note the - sign when you apply Hadamard to 1 state, and how it affects the rest of the calculations for instance when you apply two consecutive Hadamards (although this is not given, you can show it) \n",

Quantum operators have a natural restriction: They should preserve the length of the vector. Remember that in probabilistic systems, they were mapping stochastic vectors to stocasthic ones. It is similar here: quantum operators map quantum states to quantum states: states with length 1. Note that they are also reversible as quantum mechanics is reversible. Such operators are called unitary matrices in general. When you stick to real numbers only, they are called orthogonal/orthonormal. Each column is a unit vector and columns are orthogaal to each other."
